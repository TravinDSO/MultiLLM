According to the [Program Management AI Power](https://wiki.cvent.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=695349574) documentation:  1. **Ollama Use Case**: While the primary recommendation is to use the Azure OpenAI portal, Ollama is utilized when access to Azure is limited, inconvenient, or when tasks do not require high accuracy. For example, Ollama is suggested for summarizing content or for situations where local code execution is beneficial without needing online or remote API access.  2. **Approved Models**: Only a few specific LLMs (Language Models) like `llama3.1`, `codellama 34b`, and `codeqwen` are approved for use.   3. **Security Compliance and Usage Guidelines**:    - Code or SQL generated by Ollama models must be reviewed by a human before being integrated into Cvent's systems.    - Ollama’s API endpoint must not be opened for external access; usage is restricted to localhost.    - Only local file indexing is allowed, and there must be no automatic integrations with systems like Box or other cloud file stores.  Detailed instructions for setting up and using Ollama, including example scripts for different use cases such as URL validation, employee lookup, and network graph plotting, are also provided on the page.  For more information, including setup requirements, approved use cases, and additional code examples, please refer to the [Program Management AI Power](https://wiki.cvent.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=695349574) page.)

2024-08-06 09:11:58,374 - IP Address (127.0.0.1) | User (user) | LLM (Claude 3.5) | Prompt(Why is the sky blue?) | Response: (The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's a brief explanation:  1. Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum.  2. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules and other particles.  3. These collisions cause the light to scatter in all directions.  4. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than other colors, so it scatters more easily.  5. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.  6. Other colors, with longer wavelengths, pass through the atmosphere more directly.  7. At sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering the blue light away and allowing us to see more red and orange hues.  This is why the sky appears blue during most of the day, but can take on different colors at dawn and dusk.)
2024-08-06 09:12:04,711 - IP Address (127.0.0.1) | User (user) | LLM (Openai GPT4o) | Prompt(Why is the sky blue?) | Response: (The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here’s a simplified explanation:  1. **Scattering of Sunlight**: Sunlight consists of many colors, which together look white. When sunlight enters Earth’s atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air.    2. **Wavelength and Scattering**: Different colors of light have different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to red light. The shorter wavelengths are scattered more efficiently by the small particles and gas molecules in the atmosphere.  3. **Dominance of Blue**: As the blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the molecules in the air, they become much more prominent in various parts of the sky. The other colors (with longer wavelengths), like red and yellow, are scattered less and travel through the atmosphere more directly.  4. **Human Perception**: Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. As a result, we perceive the sky as blue during the day.  During sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the light must pass through a larger slice of the atmosphere. This scatters the shorter blue wavelengths out of our line of sight, allowing the longer red wavelengths to dominate.)
2024-08-06 09:12:49,548 - IP Address (127.0.0.1) | User (user) | LLM (Azure GPT4o) | Prompt(Why is the sky blue?) | Response: (The sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of many different colors, which correspond to different wavelengths of light.   Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the molecules and particles in the atmosphere. This scattering causes the blue color to be more pronounced and spread across the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes.   On the other hand, colors with longer wavelengths, such as red and yellow, are scattered less and pass through the atmosphere more directly. This is also why the sky can appear red or orange during sunrise and sunset, as the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering out the shorter-wavelength blue light and allowing the longer-wavelength red and orange light to dominate.)

Here's why:  1. **Sunlight contains all colors**: When the sun shines, it emits light of all colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. 2. **Molecules scatter shorter wavelengths**: As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules like nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light and tend to scatter the shorter (blue) wavelengths more efficiently than the longer (red) wavelengths. 3. **Blue light scattered in all directions**: As a result of scattering, the blue light is dispersed in all directions through the atmosphere. This means that we see blue light coming from every direction when we look at the sky on a clear day. 4. **Our eyes perceive the scattered light as blue**: Since our eyes are sensitive to the shorter wavelengths, we perceive the scattered blue light as the dominant color of the sky.  So, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere, which favors the shorter (blue) wavelengths over the longer (red) wavelengths.)

Here's what happens:  1. The sun emits white light, which contains all the colors of the rainbow. 2. When this light travels through the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters small molecules like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). 3. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. 4. As a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the sky, giving it its characteristic blue color.  This effect is most pronounced during the daytime when the sun is overhead and the atmosphere is relatively clear. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink because the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, scattering the shorter wavelengths even further.  So, to summarize: the sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere!)

The sky is blue because of a thing called Rayleigh scattering. Here's what happens:  1. The sun shines down on us, sending out all kinds of colors (like a big ol' rainbow). 2. When that light travels through the air in our atmosphere, it runs into tiny molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. 3. These molecules are too small to block the light, but they do scatter it in all directions. 4. The blue light gets scattered more than any other color because it's on the shorter wavelength side of the spectrum (that means it's like a little dancer, bouncing around and spreading out). 5. So, when we look up at the sky, our eyes see mostly blue light, which is why the whole thing looks... well, blue!  That's the reason for the blueness!)

2024-08-07 09:56:02,856 - IP Address (127.0.0.1) | User (user) | LLM (Azure Orchestrator) | Prompt(Is there any more information regarding AI-powered Vendor Marketplace) | Response: (Here is the relevant information on the **AI-powered Vendor Marketplace (VMP) Search**:  ### AI-powered Vendor Marketplace (VMP) Search - **Confluence Page: [AI-powered Vendor Marketplace (VMP) Search](https://wiki.cvent.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=547689288)**  #### Overview The AI-powered Vendor Marketplace (VMP) Search feature allows planners to interact with a chatbot to search for vendors and send their RFPs (Request for Proposals).  #### Key Assumptions 1. The planner is logged in, so the system knows the user's and their account's sourcing history across venues and vendors. 2. When a vendor's name is mentioned, it should be hyperlinked to their VMP profile, opening in a new tab upon click. Hovering over the name will show general information. 3. Hyperlink a category with a link to the category SRP (to be built) with sub-categories visible on hover.  #### Sample Conversations  ##### Sample Conversation A - **Bot**: "Welcome back, (USER NAME). I see you just awarded a venue RFP for (EVENT NAME OF LAST AWARDED VENUE RFP) at (NAME OF HOTEL) on (DATES OF EVENT). Are you looking to find vendors for that event?" - **Planner**: "Yes." - **Bot**: "Excellent. I'll create an RFI from your venue details. Let's see, I see you've sent your details to these vendors recently..." LIST VENDORS.    "Do you want to send your RFI to them?" - **Planner**: "Only Vendor A." - **Bot**: "Very good, done! Do you need more vendors? For an event like yours, other planners have sent theirs to (VENDOR CATEGORY), (VENDOR CATEGORY), and (VENDOR CATEGORY)." - **Planner**: "How about A/V." - **Bot**: "Perfect. Can you help me understand what you're looking for? Maybe pyrotechnics or screens?" - **Planner**: "I need three vendors who are headquartered in the US and who can provide 300-foot screens." - **Bot**: "Got it. I would recommend (VENDOR NAME), (VENDOR NAME), and (VENDOR NAME). Shall I send it to them?" - **Planner**: "Yes please." - **Bot**: "Done! Anything else?" - **Planner**: "No. Thank you." - **Bot**: "Thank you!"  ##### Sample Conversation B - **Bot**: "Good morning (USER NAME). I see this is the first time you've visited the Vendor Marketplace. How can I help?" - **Planner**: "I'm looking for an A/V vendor." - **Bot**: "Great choice, we have plenty of them! Why don't you tell me a little bit more so I can recommend the perfect vendors for you? Let's start with telling me what you need from the A/V vendors. For instance, are you looking for pyrotechnics or you need someone who can provide TVs?" - **Planner**: "I need someone who can provide 50 screens and staging setup." - **Bot**: "Got it. I know just the perfect vendors. But one more question, where is your event going to take place so I can make sure the vendors I recommend can service in that area." - **Planner**: "Washington, DC." - **Bot**: "So based on your needs I recommend (VENUE A), (VENUE B), and (VENUE C). You can click on their name to see their profile. Do these look good to you?" - **Planner**: "I like (VENUE B) and (VENUE C). Do you happen to have (VENUE D)?" - **Bot**: "Yes, we do. I'll add them to our list. Now I just need a bit more information from you so I can send these vendors enough information so they can respond to you. (ASK THE QUESTIONS ON THE RFI)....Bot - "Thank you so much, that's everything I need. Should I send your RFI now?" - **Planner**: "Yes." - **Bot**: "Done! Anything else?" - **Planner**: "No. Thank you." - **Bot**: "Thank you!"  #### Additional Details This section is used for additional notes regarding behavior, specific callouts in wires, workflows, and references to existing documentation for further context and background.

The bindi is traditionally worn by Hindu women and can symbolize various aspects such as:  1. **Marital Status**: In many regions, a red bindi signifies that a woman is married. Widows and unmarried women often wear other colors or leave their foreheads bare.     2. **Spiritual Significance**: The area between the eyebrows where the bindi is placed is considered the Ajna Chakra or the 'third eye', which is a spiritual symbol in Hinduism representing a sense of awareness and wisdom.  3. **Cultural Identity**: It serves as a mark of cultural identity and is often worn as part of traditional attire during festivals, religious ceremonies, and important social events.  4. **Adornment**: Apart from its traditional and religious significance, the bindi is also used as a fashion statement and is worn for aesthetic purposes to complement attire and jewelry.  Would you like more detailed information or perhaps some visuals on the different styles and meanings of bindis?)
